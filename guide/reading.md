# 1.1 How to Read This Manual

If you are new to `make`, or are looking for a general introduction, read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the later sections.
In each chapter, the first few sections contain introductory or general information and the later sections contain specialized or technical information.
The exception is the second chapter, [An Introduction to Makefiles](./introduction), all of which is introductory.

If you are familiar with other `make` programs, see [Features of GNU `make`](./features), which lists the enhancements GNU `make` has, and [Incompatibilities and Missing Features](./missing), which explains the few things GNU `make` lacks that others have.

For a quick summary, see [Summary of Options](./options-summary), [Quick Reference](./quick-reference), and [Special Built-in Target Names](./special-targets).
