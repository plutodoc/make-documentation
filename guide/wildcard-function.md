# 4.4.3 The Function `wildcard`

Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules.
But wildcard expansion does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the arguments of a function.
If you want to do wildcard expansion in such places, you need to use the `wildcard` function, like this:

```makefile
$(wildcard patternâ€¦)
```

This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name patterns.
If no existing file name matches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from the output of the `wildcard` function.
Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored (see [Wildcard Pitfall](./wildcard-pitfall)).

As with wildcard expansion in rules, the results of the `wildcard` function are sorted.
But again, each individual expression is sorted separately, so `$(wildcard *.c *.h)` will expand to all files matching `.c`, sorted, followed by all files matching `.h`, sorted.

One use of the `wildcard` function is to get a list of all the C source files in a directory, like this:

```makefile
$(wildcard *.c)
```

We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by replacing the `.c` suffix with `.o` in the result, like this:

```makefile
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
```

(Here we have used another function, `patsubst`.
See [Functions for String Substitution and Analysis](./text-functions).)

Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them together could be written as follows:

```makefile
objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)
```

(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so there is no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files.
See [The Two Flavors of Variables](./flavors), for an explanation of `:=`, which is a variant of `=`.)
