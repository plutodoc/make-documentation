# 4.12 Static Pattern Rules

_Static pattern rules_ are rules which specify multiple targets and construct the prerequisite names for each target based on the target name.
They are more general than ordinary rules with multiple targets because the targets do not have to have identical prerequisites.
Their prerequisites must be _analogous_, but not necessarily _identical_.
