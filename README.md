# GNU Make

GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files.
When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program.
